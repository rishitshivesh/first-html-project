<p>The Golden Ball award is presented to the best player at each FIFA World Cup finals, with a shortlist drawn up by the FIFA technical committee and the winner voted for by representatives of the media. Those who finish as runners-up in the vote receive the #C0C0C0 Ball and Bronze Ball awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively. The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, sponsored by Adidas and France Football, though fifa.com also lists in their player articles as "golden ball winners" Kempes, Cruyff, Pel�, Bobby Charlton, Garrincha and Didi for 1978, 1974, 1970, 1966, 1962 and 1958 respectively.FC Barcelona is the club with the most players (3) that have won the Golden Ball award (Johan Cruyff - 1974, Rom�rio - 1994, Lionel Messi - 2014).

<br>
<br>         
<p>The Golden Boot or Golden Shoe Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup. While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers, the first time an award was given was in 1982,under the name Golden Shoe.It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010.FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners.
If there is more than one player with the same amount of goals, since 1994 the tie-breaker goes to the player who has contributed the most assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such.If there is still more than one player, the tie-breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time.

<font size= 6 font color = #000000><u>Golden Glove Award</u></font>
<p>The Golden Glove Award is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament. The award was introduced with the name Lev Yashin Award in 1994, in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper.The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player's performance throughout the final competition. Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position, they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well, as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002. Although the Golden Glove Award was first awarded in 1994, every All-Star Team in World Cups prior to 1998 but 1990 included only one goalkeeper.

<p>The Best Young Player award was awarded for the first time at the 2006 World Cup in Germany and given to Germany's Lukas Podolski.The award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old. For the 2014 World Cup, this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 1993. The election took place on FIFA's official World Cup website with the help of The FIFA Technical Study Group.

FIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the "best young player" of the World Cup, between 1958 and 2002, named the best young player of each tournament.With 61% of the overall vote, the winner was Pel�, who finished ahead of the Peruvian Te�filo Cubillas, the best young player at Mexico 1970, and England's Michael Owen, who reached similar heights at France 98.

<p>The FIFA Fair Play Trophy is given to the team with the best record of fair play during the World Cup final tournament since 1970. Only teams that qualified for the second round are considered. The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy, a diploma, a fair play medal for each player and official, and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development.

The appearance of the award was originally a certificate. From 1982 to 1990, it had been a golden trophy based on Sport Billy, a football-playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play.Ever since 1994, it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure.Peru was the first nation to win the award after receiving no #FFFF00 or red cards in the 1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico.

<p>The All-Star Team is a team of the best performers at the respective World Cup finals. The ways in which the FIFA All-Star team members have been chosen has varied from year to year. A technical study group consisting of journalists - mostly of Europe and South America - and experts has historically chosen the team.However, in 1994 FIFA decided to add an official squad, chosen by the FIFA technical group and under the brand name MasterCard All-Star Team.The All-Star team wound up dropped prior to the 2010 tournament - coincidentally, three years after FIFA changed its sponsorship from MasterCard to Visa.
