<img src=p/44186ef7c1a0e750668704d26776919b_crop_exact.jpg>
	<font size =4>
	<p>Despite the ridiculous wealth of talent available to Belgium, they're yet to string it all together and achieve the success predicted of them half a decade ago. A disappointing Euro 2016 cost head coach Marc Wilmots his job, and now Roberto Martinez has been installed to take them to the next level.

Despite some sneers at the appointment�Martinez's stock was low after a poor 2015-16 season at Everton�they've started qualifying with four wins from four, scoring 21 and conceding just one. Their group isn't particularly weak, either; it has Greece and Bosnia and Herzegovina in it�the latter of which were beaten soundly back in October.

After recent tournament performances, few will be sticking their neck on the line and predicting the Red Devils to claim glory in 2018�and understandably so. But keep an eye on this team and how they gel under Martinez, because against all the odds, he might be the one who adds the final flourish.</p>
	<h1>9. Chile</h1>
<img src=p/hi-res-49a56b850b3baf6dc8aaf34b622bb0ee_crop_exact.jpg>	
<p>Placing Chile in these rankings was an agonising task. On the one hand, they've strung together two consecutive Copa America victories�one on home soil, then one in the Centenario edition in the USA�but on the other hand, the World Cup stage has recently seen them fall short after promising so much.

Manager Juan Antonio Pizzi has done a great job picking up where the revered Jorge Sampaoli left off, imbuing La Roja with the intensity and high-speed play that gets the best out of star men Arturo Vidal and Alexis Sanchez. That he was able to deliver success in his first year in charge astounded many.

Heading to the finals in 2018 they'll be many people's second team, but can they transfer their relentless Copa form to the world stage?</p>

	<h1>8. Uruguay</h1>
<img src=p/hi-res-ef3d8ea3412d1463b00126b043a78e70_crop_exact.jpg>
	<p>Uruguay have put themselves in a strong position from which to qualify for the 2018 World Cup; at no stage in their history have they had as many points (23) as they have now with six games to go.

With Edinson Cavani in phenomenal form this season for both club and country�he has 38 goals this season for Paris Saint-Germain in all competitions, per Transfermarkt, and eight in this CONMEBOL qualifying campaign, per FIFA�confidence will be high that he can continue to make the difference. The onus will rest even more heavily on him this week as Luis Suarez is suspended for La Celeste's bout with Brazil.

Oscar Tabarez's men are superbly set up for tournament football, offering bountiful amounts of grit in midfield, a rock-solid central defensive pairing that includes Diego Godin, and strikers who play for some of Europe's best clubs.</p>

	<h1>7. Portugal</h1>
<img src=p/hi-res-1be9e70d5cd5b3001c06d4159bb0024a_crop_exact.jpg>	
<p>European champions Portugal are, right now, staring the possibility of a play-off spot in the face�but that probably won't concern any of the Selecao.

Traditional slow starters, Cristiano Ronaldo and Co. have frequently relied on play-offs to reach major tournaments and, if anything, it seems to help them when they reach the finals.

Manager Fernando Santos does have some problems he'll need to address, though, and this is the reason Portugal are not our top-ranked European side.

Ronaldo will be 33 by the time the finals roll around next year, Pepe 35, and Jose Fonte 34. That's your star player and your central-defensive axis (which was so impressive at Euro 2016) all pushing on a little too far for comfort.

There are positives, though, as the emergence of a No. 9 (finally!) should solve plenty of Santos' formation issues, while there are at least eight brilliant central midfielders all vying for spots.

But there was also an amazement factor about Portugal's victory in France last summer, and not many will expect them to manage it again in Russia.</p>

	<h1>6. Spain</h1>
<img src=p/f69191169130cf284405439778a4a4b5_crop_exact.jpg>
<p>Spain's earlier-than-expected exit from Euro 2016 served as the final straw for Vicente del Bosque, who, to be honest, had held on to his job as manager for far too long. There came a point where a change clearly had to be made, and the Spanish FA duly obliged...24 months later.

Under Julen Lopetegui's command, the differences aren't exactly stark, but the squad call-ups do at least have a semblance of merit about them, and it should create a more energised atmosphere.

They've also been characteristically difficult to score against, conceding just one goal�a Daniele De Rossi penalty�while plundering 15 at the other end.

Spain will travel to Russia six years removed from a major international title and eight beyond their victory in South Africa. This is, largely, an entirely new generation of players who must prove worthy of the heavyweight tag they'll be attributed.</p>
