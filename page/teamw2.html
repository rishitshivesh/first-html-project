	<h1>5. Argentina</h1>
<img src=p/a523f8d8241a681287b1f9c19cc1d2eb_crop_exact.jpg>	
<p>The last three consecutive summers have seen Argentina fall at the final hurdle, settling for second place in two Copa Americas and one World Cup. If you're feeling uneasy about labelling them a genuine contender for Russia 2018�despite the presence of the world's best player�you are not alone.

They've contrived to make life extremely difficult for themselves during the CONMEBOL qualifiers and sit in fifth place, making them even more difficult to trust. That's only good enough for an inter-confederation play-off, not an automatic spot at the finals.

That said, they're a point off Chile and Ecuador in fourth and third, respectively, and are fully expected to make it to Russia without having to face a play-off fixture in Auckland, New Zealand.

With the attacking talent available to coach Edgardo Bauza, they should be one of the most deadly teams to take to the stage next summer.

Remember: they do have Lionel Messi, so...</p>

	<h1>4. Italy</h1>
<img src=p/e55d308cde5c2a097fe64b82d8d17e59_crop_exact.jpg>	
<p>This most recent squad announcement for the Italian national team is packed full of young talent; if it matures in time for the summer of 2018, Gian Piero Ventura could become the mastermind of one of the finest Italy sides in history.

The Azzurri were one of the most impressive sides at Euro 2016, and although that was under former boss Antonio Conte, they've started strongly in qualifying with 10 points from a possible 12 under Ventura�including a creditable draw with Spain.

One thing Italy have lacked in recent years is a go-to striking option, but this year Manolo Gabbiadini has caught fire for Southampton, while Torino's Andrea Belotti has emerged as one of the finest poachers in world football.

Does that complete the set for Ventura and allow him to mount a serious World Cup challenge? They have the tournament pedigree that entices you to believe it so.</p>

	<h1>3. France</h1>
<img src=p/3942c250a8614c3589702b2982472719_crop_exact.jpg>
<p>For this round of internationals, Didier Deschamps was forced to replace Paul Pogba in his France squad due to injury. In the Manchester United man's place steps Tiemoue Bakayoko, a Champions League quarter-finalist with AS Monaco and current Jose Mourinho target, per ESPN FC. Talk about the definition of squad depth.

Since losing the final of Euro 2016, Les Bleus have only got stronger. More and more quality players are emerging from the woodwork, meaning Deschamps' squad selection is going to be one of the most difficult in footballing history.

The team have started well in qualifying, securing 10 points from a possible 12 having beaten the Netherlands and Sweden, and they show no signs of needing exiled striker Karim Benzema due to the immense Antoine Griezmann.</p>

	<h1>2. Brazil</h1>
<img src=p/hi-res-4abd6778462593f310f497fa7137876b_crop_exact.jpg>	
<p>It's been smooth sailing for Tite since taking over Dunga's position as manager of the Brazilian national team in June 2016, winning six games from six in the CONMEBOL qualifiers. That run includes the 3-0 thwacking of Argentina at home and the 3-0 defeat of an extremely strong Ecuador team away.

This week's fixture against Uruguay in Montevideo is hugely significant; if the Selecao win, they'll pull seven points clear of their opponents, all but sealing passage to the 2018 World Cup in the process. 

A team equipped with Gabriel Jesus, Neymar, Philippe Coutinho and Willian in the front line were always expected to deliver, and they duly have: a plus-19 goal difference after 12 games dwarfs all others. But they've also only conceded once during Tite's reign (an own goal), signifying how solid they are at the other end, too.

In short, be scared of Brazil.</p>

	<h1>1. Germany</h1>
<img src=p/33287a7eddf2591530e4d13edf666311_crop_exact.jpg>	
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Germany are top of the pile when it comes to predicting which nation is most likely to win the 2018 World Cup at this point in time.

Die Mannschaft became the first European team in history to win the tournament on South American soil in 2014, beating Brazil and Argentina en route to glory, and they will be looking to defend their crown in Russia.

They've started qualifying in perfect fashion, winning four games from four, and are already well clear at the top of Group C.

Given the strong start they've made, the fact they'll enter the tournament as champions and with their historic, seemingly ingrained ability to shoulder pressure and excel on the big stage, they're an easy choice for No. 1 here.
