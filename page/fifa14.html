	<center><p>The FIFA World Cup is the world�s largest single-event sporting competition in the world.
While it brings important direct and indirect economic and social benefits to the host
country its impacts on society and environment are indisputable.
<p>As stated by FIFA Secretary General, J�r�me Valcke, staging a world-class event of
such global magnitude requires careful consideration of all aspects to ensure a balanced
approach and sustainable outcome (FIFA, 2012). FIFA and the Local Organizing Committee
(LOC) take this responsibility very seriously and are committed to deliver a sustainable
2014 FIFA World Cup� in Brazil. This commitment is reflected in a strategy and action
plan to reduce the event impacts. The 2014 FIFA World Cup� Sustainability Strategy aims
at organizing and implementing the 2014 FIFA World Cup� in a sustainable manner by
reducing the negative and increasing the positive impacts of the event on society and the
environment. One of its cornerstones is to have a clear understanding of the volume of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by event preparation and staging.
<p>The 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany was the first tournament in which measurable
environmental targets were set and monitored. Green Goal was introduced as the
environmental programme to reduce the negative environmental impacts of the
tournament (FIFA, 2006). For the first time in the history of football, environmental
protection was given official project status at the FIFA World Cup, plotting a new course for
the football world. 
The South African LOC took FIFA�s environmental commitment on board and created an
environment unit to manage the Green Goal activities as an important part of the legacy of
the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa�. They based their programme on experiences from
2006. (FIFA, 2010).
<p>Building on the project from 2006, for the FIFA Women�s World Cup 2011� in Germany, the
Organizing Committee implemented an ambitious environmental protection programme for
the tournament (FIFA, 2011). As a clear sign of its growing commitment to the environment
following Germany and South Africa, FIFA decided to include environmental matters and
environmental protection as a mandatory part of future bidding agreements starting with
the recent bidding process for the FIFA World Cup� in 2018 and 2022. FIFA requested
comprehensive information on plans to avoid, reduce and offset negative environmental
impacts (FIFA CSR, 2013).
<p>In that context, the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil�, from now on referred to as 2014 FWC
Brazil, is an important stepping-stone in that process as it is expected to help build the
basis for sustainable FIFA World Cups.
The carbon footprint of FIFA World Cups has been quantified in 2006, 2010 and 2011 by
various stakeholders, including FIFA, the LOC and third parties (FIFA, 2006; Econ P�yry,
2009; and FIFA, 2011).
<p> Each of these studies has used its own set of organizational and
operational boundaries and reporting periods. As a step towards creating a standard
framework that can be used as a benchmark for future FIFA World Cups and other sporting
events, FIFA is proposing for the 2014 FWC Brazil carbon footprint a methodology that
incorporates key concepts from recognized GHG emissions accounting and reporting
protocols but also builds upon key findings from other previous studies as discussed in the
methodology section of this footprint.
<p>Another important aspect introduced by this carbon footprint is that it includes emissions
not only for the staging events of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil� but also for the 2013
FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil and major preparation events starting in July 2011 with the
FWC Preliminary Draw until the end of September 2014.
<p>This document presents the approach chosen for and main results of the ex-ante carbon
footprint that estimates the GHG emissions from preparation and staging events of the 2014
<p>FIFA World Cup Brazil�. <table border=2>
