<p>For the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations - the 209 FIFA member associations minus automatically qualified hosts Russia - entered the qualifying process. Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.<br>

Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.The first qualification game began in Dili, Timor Leste, on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC's qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg on 25 July 2015 at 18:00 local time (UTC+3).</p><hr>

<p> As of 15 November 2017, thirty countries excluding hosts Russia have secured qualification to the final tournament through the qualification process. Of these, twenty countries competed at the previous edition of the tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.Other teams returning after absences of more than three tournaments include: Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; and Egypt, returning to the finals after a 28-year absence from their last appearance in 1990.<br>

Notable countries that failed to qualify include four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958) and 2014 third-place finishers Netherlands. Three reigning continental champions failed to qualify: two-time Copa Amï¿½rica champion and 2017 Confederations Cup runner-up Chile; CONCACAF Gold Cupchampion United States (for the first time since 1986), and 2017 Africa Cup of Nationschampion Cameroon. The other longest qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, who had both made the previous three tournaments.</p>
