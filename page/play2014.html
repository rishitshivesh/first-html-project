<p><font size ="5">The 2018 FIFA World Cup will be the 21st FIFA World Cup, a quadrennial international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. It is scheduled to take place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018,after the country was awarded the hosting rights on 2 December 2010. This will be the first World Cup held in Europe since 2006; all but one of the stadium venues are in European Russia, west of the Ural Mountains to keep travel time manageable.<br><br>
The final tournament will involve 32 national teams, which include 31 teams determined through qualifying competitions and the automatically qualified host team. A total of 64 matches will be played in 12 venues located in 11 cities. The final will take place on 15 July in Moscow at the Luzhniki Stadium.
<br><br>This will be the first World Cup with Iceland and Panama as participants. The winners of the World Cup will qualify for the 2021 FIFA Confederations Cup.</p>

<p><center><h1><center>10. Angel Di Maria </h1><br><IMG SRC=P/ANGELDI.JPG HEIGHT=300><br> <p>The Argentine is well remembered for the decisive goal he scored against Switzerland, converting Lionel Messi's clever run into a low shot into the bottom left corner to send his side through to the quarter finals. He was an important player, who sent numerous good crosses for his side throughout the tournament, making it a walk in the park for his fellow attackers. Alongside Lionel Messi, he provided considerable strength to the La Albiceleste attack in the 2014 world cup.

<p><center><h1><center>9. Mats Hummels </h1><br><IMG SRC=P/MATSHUM.JPG HEIGHT=300><br><p> Hummels became a key figure in the German backline throughout the tournament and the defender was particularly impressive in the 1<br><br>0 quarter final win over France. The Die Mannschaft defender was like a rock in the back of the field, neutralizing the biggest attacking players. Hummels was held in high regard by managers because of his heroic defending. Hummels also scored important and desperately needed goals for his team.

<p><center><h1><center>8. Thiago Silva </h1><br><IMG SRC=P/THIAGO.JPG HEIGHT=300><br><p> Thiago Silva was defensive brilliance in short. The host's captain was sorely missed when Germany ran riot, and his 7 important blocks saw him included into various rankings in the 2014 world cup. Despite the team's humiliating exit and much criticism for Thiago, the Sele��o played like heroes under his leadership. Silva was very connected to the rest of the Brazilian team and gave his best as a leader.

<p><center><h1><center>7. Karim Benzema </h1><br><IMG SRC=P/KARIM.JPG HEIGHT=300><br><p> France's talismanic striker, though not reaching the semi<br><br>finals, which was quite expected, was excellent in France's campaign. He put a staggering 25 shots on target, though scoring only 3 goals. There can be no doubt that Benzema carried a lot of France's responsibilities on his shoulders and toiled hard to lead the Les Bleus to the quarter finals. Real Madrid's star striker, Benzema could have been much more promising, had the rest of the French team played as good.

<p><center><h1><center>6. Neymar Jr. </h1><br><IMG SRC=P/NEYMARJR.JPG HEIGHT=300><br> <p>Neymar's performance in the 2014 world cup was critical in helping the Sele��o as he scored 4 goals and had one assist in 5 matches. However, unfortunately, his performance in the world cup was marred in the quarter final match against Colombia, when Neymar suffered a fractured vertebrae injury after Colombian defender Juan Zuniga kneed him in the back. Following the injury, Neymar was carried off the field in tears. His skill and perseverance was outstanding.

<p><center><h1><center>5. Stefan de Vrij </h1><br><IMG SRC=P/STEFAN.PNG HEIGHT=300><br><p> The Dutch centre<br><br>back formed a part of a solid back three unit, keeping 4 clean sheets and recovering more balls, 58, than anyone else in the tournament. Vrij won most tackles in the tournament, 20, which made him a market target for various clubs. He also made 50 effective clearances, third after Ezequiel Garay and Ron Vlaar. Stefan de Vrij also won the most duels in the tournament, 53, for the Oranje.

<p><center><h1><center>4. Thomas M�ller </h1><br><IMG SRC=P/THOMAS.JPG HEIGHT=300><br><p> Germany's attacking all<br><br>rounder came one goal short of Rodriguez's golden boot tally but his hard<br><br>running and goal<br><br>scoring exploits ensured he made the top 5. M�ller was the "killer gene" in the Die Mannschaft squad for their 2014 campaign. It is easy to be sniffy about M�ller, he is all arms and legs, but he scored a huge 5 goals in the tournament. There seems to be long passages, where he seems to do nothing at all, but he turns out to be a match<br><br>winner.

<p><center><h1><center>3. James Rodriguez </h1><br><IMG SRC=P/JAMES.JPG HEIGHT=300><br> <p>The Bayern attacking midfielder scored 6 goals for Colombia, one more than teammate M�ller. The Los Cafeteros star has been rewarded for his sensational goalscoring exploits at world cup 2014 with the Golden Boot. The attacking midfielder was the breakout star in Brazil, inspiring his side to a first<br><br>ever quarter final appearance by netting 6 times in just 5 games. Not even properly known before the campaign, Rodriguez rose to great heights after his fantastic performance.

<p><center><h1><center>2. Arjen Robben </h1><br><IMG SRC=P/ARJEN.JPG HEIGHT=300><br> <p>M�ller's Bayern teammate enjoyed an excellent tournament for Netherlands, sometimes playing as a centre<br><br>forward as well as his traditional wide berth and scoring 3 times. He was arguably the most valuable player in the world cup. His chemistry with striker partner Robin Van Persie is undeniable. He broke the world cup's all time speed record, at a top speed of 37 km/h, one that rivals some of the top Olympic sprinters.

<p><center><h1><center>1. Toni Kroos </h1><br><IMG SRC=P/TONI.JPG HEIGHT=300><br> <p>The German pass master excelled, scoring twice in the 7<br><br>1 semi final victory over Brazil and displaying his creative brilliance throughout the tournament. His performance impressed even his coaches, who gave him the role of Germany's main ball distributor. Even the Real Madrid midfielder was himself surprised to have covered 11.7 kms during the match in Salvador, having 88% passing accuracy. He says he relishes the role of "making his teammates look good."
