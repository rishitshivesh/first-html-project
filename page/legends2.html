<center><p><h1>5. Lionel Messi</h1></p>
<img src=p\_6192579.jpg>
	<font size =4>
	<p>The best player playing today and the star of a remarkable Barcelona team for over ten years. Messi is a creative forward that can play from wide or central positions, drifting from deep, beating players and setting up and scoring goals seemingly out of nowhere, and being the creative pulse of the team. He has shown remarkable consistency in La Liga, scoring 278 goals in 309 games, and scoring more goals than the number of games played in three seasons, including an astonishing  record 73 goals in all competitions 2011/12. He has won the Ballon D'Or five times, more than anyone else ever, and is the all-time leading scorer in the European Cup.  

His form for Argentina, while still impressive has generally not matched his club form and he is not revered in his home country the same way that Maradona still is. Aged only 18 in the 2006 World Cup he did not start any games, in 2010 he played very well, despite not scoring but disappointed in comparison to his ability (he was not named in the team of the tournament). In the 2014 World Cup he impressed, especially in the early games, winning more man-of-the-match awards than anyone else, and taking his team to the Final. He was awarded the Golden Ball (a choice that many football writers disagreed with). However, the greatest players are rightly judged on their ability to produce for their team when it really matters. In the 2014 Final against Germany the game went into extra time with the score at 0-0. A moment of magic from Messi, like he had produced many times before for Barcelona, would have won his country the World Cup but Messi did not rise to the occasion and Argentina lost. This is what separates Messi from the players above him.  He will be 30 when the next World Cup starts so may yet have another chance to improve his ranking, though he may not be presented such a good opportunity again. In the meantime he continues to dazzle for Barcelona.


<h1>4. Franz Beckenbauer</h1>
<img src=p\_6557492.jpg>
	<font size =4>
	<p>No one has ever achieved more success for both club and country then 'Der Kaiser'. For Bayern Munich he won three back-to-back European Cups from 1974-76. For his country he won the Wolrd Cup. After impressing in the 1966 and 1970 World Cups, and winning the 1972 European Championships, he captained his side to win the trophy in 1974. He would go on to win the World Cup again as manager in 1990. He made the All Star Team for all three World Cups he played in and was named the Best Young Player in 1966, where he marked Charlton out of the final.

What is more impressive is that Beckenbauer was the most influential player in these great teams (both Bayern Munich and West Germany), and did this from a central defensive position rather than as a midfielder or forward, which is almost unparalleled. He genius also rests on the fact that he was tactically innovative, developing the role of the 'attacking libero' - starting from a sweeper position he surged forward to launch attacks. In addition to great positional awareness and tackling ability he had great vision and passing range. Moreover, he was a great leader, acting as captain and example for his team. Repeatedly recognised by his peers, he was twice winner of the European Footballer of the Year. In short, he achieved all he possibly could from his position, even expanding the parameters of how that position could be played, leading both his club and country teams to win the greatest trophies possible.

<p><h1>3. Johann Cruyff</h1></p>
<img src=p\_7984733.jpeg>
	<font size =4>
	<p>Johann Cruyff was an incredibly skilful and creative player. He was also a great thinker about the game and leader on the pitch. He worked with his coach Rinus Michels to develop the Total Football system, in which players interchanged positions, attacked with fluidity and defended by closing down space. Cruyff pulled the strings on the pitch to implement this great vision and acted as inspiration to his team. A great dribbler, passer and goalscorer - so skilful that he developed his own move - the 'Cruyff turn' - he played with a verve and freedom that was a joy to watch. Nominally a striker, he  would also drop deep to organise team and act as playmaker.

With this new system, and his own genius, Cruyff, would help take Ajax from being a small local club to European heavyweights, winning three consecutive European Cups from 1970-72. In so doing he was named European Footballer of the Year three times. More signififcantly, Total Football would transform the way the game is played to this day. Michels and Cruyff took their tactical approach, and most of the Ajax players, to the Netherlands national team. Previously football minnows they now wowed the world in the 1974 World Cup. Looking like favourites from the start they came unstuck in Final against West Germany, seemingly beaten by their own focus on style above results, in contrast to the more ruthless Germans. Cruyff was the central figure in a very talented team and won the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. A bad experience with the media unfortunately meant that he ruled himself out of the 1978 World Cup. His teammates would go to the Final again and lose to the hosts Argentina. With Cruyff in the team they may well have won. As it was, they remain one of the greatest teams never to have won the World Cup.

Cruyff left Ajax for Barcelona, where we again be instrumental in changing the tactics and becoming the star of the team. When he returned as manager he put in place a way of playing that has informed the tactical approach of the club ever since, and leading his 'dream team' to a European Cup win in 1992. His influence as a player, and manager, has fundamentally shaped the way the game is played today. He sadly passed away in 2016, Ajax have since announced their stadium will be renamed in his honour.

<p><h1>2.Diego Maradona</h1></p>
<img src=p\_9682014.jpg>
	<font size =4>
	<p>There may be several legends on this list that have led their teams to win the World Cup but no other can claim to have done this single-handedly to the extent that Diego Maradona did in 1986, scoring five goals and making five assists in seven games. The Argentina team of that year  included a few very good players (Valdano, Burruchago) but they were by no means a great team and would certainly not have won the trophy without Maradona. Playing in a free attacking midfield role he would pick up the ball from deep, beat players and set up chances with great vision, or often he would go on long dribbling runs and score spectacular individual goals by himself. Nowhere was this more apparent that his second goal in the quarter-final against England where he dribbled from his own half and scored. This is generally regarded as the greatest World Cup goal ever scored and perfectly captures his genius: creating chances from nothing and using mesmerising control to score spectacular goals.

His influence on his team was therefore immense, and by extension he has become a hero for his country, transcending football. Through the appeal of watching him play he also became a standard bearer for football itself, being named the Player of the Tournament for that World Cup (probably the easiest choice for this award ever) and was one of the key players to watch in the 1990 and 1994 tournaments (after failing to live up to expectations in 1982). Evidence of his importance can be seen in the number of opposition players that marked him in these later campaigns. Although never reaching the same heights as 1986 he was always capable of producing moments of brilliance and he won third place for the Golden Ball in 1990.

To underscore his individual importance Maradona delivered similar success at club level. His club career may have been patchy, after bursting onto the scene at Boca Juniors he generally disappointed after a major transfer to Barcelona (for various reasons), but it was at Napoli that he enhanced his reputation. Joining this underachieving, unfashionable club, he led them to challenge the northern elite and win two league titles and a UEFA Cup. His �street-fighting� style - of fighting for the underdog and using dirty tricks when he needed to (such as his first goal hand-ball against England in 1986), seemed to suit his blue-collar choice of clubs (Boca Juniors and Napoli), and doubtless derived from his background in a poor barrio of Buenos Aires. It is this also that fits elements of the Argentine character and elevates him to a national hero.

There is of course another side of Maradona. His willingness to cheat extended beyond the pitch and he dramatically failed a doping test that ruled him out of the remainder on the 1994 World Cup. This followed a similar ban for cocaine use three years earlier. His poor professional discipline has certainly limited the longevity of his achievements but what he achieved when he was at his best is enough to place him very highly in the pantheon of legends, though perhaps eternally second to...


<p><h1>1. Pele</h1></p>
<img src=p\Pele-WithMedals-300.jpg>
	<font size =4>
	<p>DPele is and always will be the greatest footballer ever. It is a role he wears very comfortably. His play, full of joy and exuberance, seems to sum up everything that the world loves about the game and as he travels the globe acting as its greatest ambassador his own legend is reinforced.

He is fully deserving of this title though. He remains the only player ever to inspire his country to win the World Cup twice: in 1958 and 1970 (injury ended his 1962 campaign early). His team-mate Garrincha runs him close but Pele was the clear star of two teams, just eclipsing Garrincha in 1958. He was only 17 when he was introduced in the 1958 tournament in Sweden, he then scored a hat-trick to help his team reach the final and scored twice in the final itself. His tears at the final whistle showed a humanity that endeared the watching world to him from then on. The following year he was named best player in the 1959 South American Championship, scoring 8 goals. His participation was limited by injury in the 1962 World Cup and Brazil were beaten by heavy tackling in 1966.  By 1970 he was coaxed out of his intended retirement to lead another, wholly different all-star team to glory. He played as a classic number 10, dropping back and engaging in some impeccable link-up play and demonstrating great vision - his pass to a seemingly unseen Carlos Alberto for the fourth goal in the 1970 Final remains the best lay-off in history. He could also beat players and score gaols in a great variety of ways, showing that he really was the complete forward. He remains Brazil's record goalscorer.

He is also separated from other legends by the fact that he has proven himself equally through his club career. He remained in Brazil, at Santos throughout his prime years and was the star attraction in a team that swept all before them. It is true that they played a lot of unimportant friendly matches, but they also played some very important games. After winning the Copa Libertadores in both 1962 and 1963, each time they unequivocally answered any questions of relative worth in comparison with European football by comprehensively beating that years European Cup winners: beating Benfica 5-2 away in 1962 and seeing off AC Milan in 1963, both opponents among the greatest club sides of all time. 650 goals in 694 competitive club games tells its own story (nevermind the 1000+ goals that also included friendlies).

Pele is now a true global icon, one of very few in sport, and is indivisbly linked to the game in the public imagination. When the world thinks of football it thinks of Pele, and not just football but el joga bonito (the 'beautiful game') as Pele named it. It is an association that football benefits from, and that is the best summary of why Pele is number 1.
