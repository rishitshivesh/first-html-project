			<p><h1><center>10. Zinedine Zidane</h1></p>
	<center><img src=p\_9285609.jpg>
	<font size =4>
	<p>One of the greatest midfielders the game has ever known. Zidane played with such elegance, vision and sublime technique that when a film was made consisting solely of slow motion footage of him playing in one game it was taken entirely seriously as piece of art.  In the 1998 World Cup Zidane succeeded where Platini had previously failed, winning the trophy to become a unifying symbol for his country. In truth he had not fully lived-up to his reputation until the Final when he rose to the occasion and scored twice to lift the trophy, although Brazil had problems of their own that day (see Ronaldo below). Zidane's greatest moment for France came two years later in Euro 2000 when he was the undisputed star of the competition and the inspirational player leading France to victory. After both he and his country disappointed in both the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004 he surprised the world with an Indian summer in 2006, becoming the player of the tournament and unexpectedly taking France to the Final. Ill discipline has always been part of his game though; he missed several World Cup games due to suspension. This would cost him and his country in the 2006 Final, his last ever game, when he was sent off for headbutting Marco Materazzi, and France lost. By this point he had already been named player of the tournament.

At club level he moved from France to join Juventus in 1996, where he proved himself a vital player for them from the outset. He helped them to win two league titles and reach two European Cup Finals but lost in both of them. In 2001 Zidane joined Real Madrid's Galaticos line-up in a 75 million Euro  deal. There he would become arguably the team's most important player, scheming from midfield, passing with incredible vision, setting up assists and scoring exquisite goals. His greatest goal was probably the volley he scored in the 2002 Champions League Final, an individual piece of brilliance that finally won him the trophy. One of the very few players to be named European Footballer of the Year three times he remains a legend for both his international and club career. 


</p><h1>9. Ronaldo</h1>
<img src=p\_9219585.jpg>
	<font size =4>
	<p>Ronaldo is a player with a great story, one that is interwoven with the history of the World Cup. When he led Brazil to the trophy in 2002, scoring 8 goals in the process, he was validating a personal comeback and claiming the recognition he deserved for his career up to that point.  He exploded on the world scene with his one season at Barcelona in 1996/97, scoring 47 goals in 49 games and taking the club to a Cup Winners Cup trophy. His pace, dribbling and goalscoring ability was incredible, accompanied by a masterful close control gained from his early career as a futsal player. This was the best form of his career and he won the FIFA World Player in 1996 at the age of just 20. For Brazil, in the 1997 Copa America he formed a formidable partnership with Romario, driving his team to win the trophy, which he would win again in 1999.  After just one season at Barcelona he moved to Inter Milan where he continued to impress, maintaining his impressive goal tally against tough Italian defences and expanding his repertoire with assists and free kicks, inspiring his club to win the UEFA Cup. He was the real star of the 1998 World Cup (winning the Golden Ball), in probably the best team in the tournament. We will probably never really know what happened on the day of the Final but the truth is that Ronaldo experienced some kind of seizure and, despite being eventually selected, was visibly far not himself in the game, which affected the whole team and led to France winning the trophy. 

Ronaldo succumbed to major injury at Inter, rupturing as knee tendon twice and missing most of two seasons, but recovering in time for the 2002 World Cup. It was amazing that he recovered to play at all, but he inspired another great Brazil team to win the 2002 World Cup, this time teaming up with Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. This led to the third of his FIFA World Player of the Year awards and sealed a major transfer to Real Madrid�s �Galacticos�. He impressed for two years for Madrid and maintained an impressive goal ratio over his time there (83 goals in 127 games over 5 years). Most notably he starred in a 3-1 away demolition of Manchester United in which he scored a hatrick and was given a standing ovation by both sets of supporters (including this writer). At this point in his career he lacked the pace of his youth but this was compensated for by an innate understanding of where to be, and when, in order to score. By 2005 his party lifestyle and injury history were catching up with him. He played for AC Milan and for a succession of clubs in Brazil and retired in 2011.

<p><h1>8. Alfredo di Stefano</h1></p>
<img src=p\_1616630.jpg>
	<font size =4>
	<p>The great Alfredo di Stefano was the undisputed leader, star player and eternal symbol of the greatest club side ever seen, leading Real Madrid to win five back-to-back European Cups, a feat that has not ever looked like being repeated since. In so doing he became an inspiration to countless other players, including several other legends on this list (notably Charlton and Eusebio). He also promoted the game, and more specifically the European Cup, earning praise throughout the world and bringing thousands flocking to see him.

Di Stefano first came to prominence at River Plate in his native Argentina, developing his game with a loan spell at Huracan and a sojourn to Colombia's all-star break-away league. In 1953 he moved to Spain, with Real Madrid winning a tug-of-war for his services. At Madrid he was nominally a centre-forward but he would show great stamina shuttling back and forward to help and organise his defence and midfield [this makes him very difficult to categorise but we have listed him as an attacking midfielder]. Surely the most complete player the game has seen and in many ways the first modern footballer, he would drop back and receive the ball from the keeper. He could tackle, surge forward and not be missed in attack with his pace, still managing to score 216 goals in 282 games for Real. He scored in all five European Cup Finals between 1955 and 1960 and won the European Footballer of the Year award twice in this period.

Di Stefano does not have the same track record at international level, playing for Spain after he left Argentina and never playing in a World Cup. His international career is not without success though - he helped Argentina win the 1947 South American Championship, scoring 6 goals in 6 games.


<p><h1>7. Ferenc Puskas</h1></p>
<img src=p\_1101599.png>
	<font size =4>
	<p>Puskas was one of the greatest players of all time and an innovator of the way the game is played. He scored an incredible 83 goals in 85 games for Hungary and 514 goals in 529 games at club level. This makes him the most prolific international goalscorer of all time, incredibly a record that still stands today.

Puskas effectively had two careers, each of which would place him on the list of legends. First he was the captain and star player in the great 'Magical Magyars' Hungary team of the 1950s - the team that beat England 6-3 at Wembley (and 7-1 in Budapest) and revolutionised tactical play, by introducing withdrawn forwards, fluid positional play and a strong team ethic, changing how football is played to this day. These tactics came jointly from the players and Puskas played a key role in implementing them on the pitch, even adapting play during games to exploit the opposition. Hungary were undoubtedly the best team in the world between 1950 and 1954; they were unbeaten in this period and had many stunning victories against other great sides, home and away. They were the favourites for the 1954 World Cup and looked set to win it with 9-0 and 8-3 victories in their early games (the second result was against West Germany). In the second game though Puskas fractured his angle, which kept him out of the next two games. Amazingly he played the Final, and scored, but could not lead Hungary to victory, indeed there were several questionable refereeing decision in this match. Hungary had another unbeaten run lasting until 1956 but in that year the Soviet tanks rolled in and Puskas became one of thousands of refugees to flee the country. Banned for 18 months by FIFA, lying low in Italy, two stone overweight it looked the end of his career. Instead he joined the famous Real Madrid side of Di Stefano (probably the greatest club side ever). There his success continued, he helped Madrid win two European Cups, scoring 4 goals in the 1960 Final, generally regarded as the best game of all time. He would score a hat-trick in the 1962 Final (which was not enough to beat Benfica) and would also play in the 1964 Final at the age of 37. 


	<p><h1>6. Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
<img src=p\cr7.png>
	<font size =4>
	<p>A modern day great that sits comfortably alongside past legends. Ronaldo was signed at 18 by Manchester United after impressing in a pre-season friendly and he would go on to inspire the club to three league titles and a European Cup win in 2008. Always an exciting dribbler gifted with pace, United transformed him from an out-and-out winger to a more complete player that drifted infield and scored a phenomenal number and range of goals. He is also a great free-kick and penalty taker. After moving to Real Madrid he would continue his astonishing goal record, despite mostly starting from wide positions, and he continues to perform with remarkable consistency. Becoming the key player in a great side he lit up La Liga with a personal rivalry with Lionel Messi, leading his club to a tenth European Cup win in 2014.  It is his misfortunate to share the stage with the slightly superior Messi but that has not stopped him winning the Ballon d'Or/European Footballer of the Year an incredible four times (once with Manchester United).  He may be more comfortable in the limelight, and perhaps he is driven by egotism, but he has always matched his talent with great dedication and won the respect and admiration of his teammates. Now surely Portugal�s greatest ever player,  Ronaldo has played in three World Cups but unfortunately disappointed in all of them, otherwise he would have been higher in this list. However he inspired Portugal to win the 2016 European Cup, showing great leadership and influence in the Final from the touchline when he was injured early in the game.
